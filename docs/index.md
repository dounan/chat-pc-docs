## Subscription plans

The default free plan has a lifetime credit limit as well as other limitations. You can manage your subscription plan in the app settings.

Check out the [available subscription plans](https://chatpc.ai/plans).

With a subscription plan, you can enter your own OpenAI/Anthropic API keys to avoid using your ChatPC credits. You can set your API keys under `Settings > General > Personal API Keys`.
